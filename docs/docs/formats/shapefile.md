# Shapefile Format

## Description

Shapefile is a popular geospatial vector data format developed by ESRI. Despite its name, a shapefile actually consists of multiple files (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, etc.) that work together. This implementation uses the `pyshp` library to read and write shapefiles.

## File Extensions

- `.shp` - Shapefile main file
- `.shapefile` - Shapefile (alias)

## Implementation Details

### Reading

The Shapefile implementation:
- Reads `.shp` files using `pyshp` library
- Extracts geometry (Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint)
- Extracts attribute data from associated `.dbf` file
- Converts to GeoJSON-like feature format
- Handles multiple geometry types

### Writing

Writing support:
- Writes shapefiles with geometry and attributes
- Automatically determines shape type from first record
- Creates field definitions based on property types
- Supports Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint geometries
- Creates all necessary shapefile components (.shp, .shx, .dbf)

### Key Features

- **Industry standard**: Widely used in GIS industry
- **Multiple files**: Automatically handles multiple component files
- **Geometry types**: Supports Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint
- **Attributes**: Full attribute data support
- **Type detection**: Automatically detects geometry and attribute types

## Usage

```python
from iterable.helpers.detect import open_iterable

# Basic reading
source = open_iterable('data.shp')
for feature in source:
    print(feature)  # Each feature is a dict with geometry and properties
    # feature['type'] == 'Feature'
    # feature['geometry'] contains geometry data
    # feature['properties'] contains attributes
source.close()

# Writing
dest = open_iterable('output.shp', mode='w')
feature = {
    'type': 'Feature',
    'geometry': {'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [102.0, 0.5]},
    'properties': {
        'id': '1',
        'name': 'Location'
    }
}
dest.write(feature)
dest.close()
```

## Parameters

- `encoding` (str): File encoding (default: `utf8`)

## Limitations

1. **pyshp dependency**: Requires `pyshp` package
2. **File path required**: Requires filename, not stream
3. **Multiple files**: Shapefile consists of multiple files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, etc.)
4. **Geometry types**: Limited to Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint
5. **Field types**: Field types are determined from first record
6. **Memory usage**: All features are loaded into memory during reading

## Compression Support

Shapefiles cannot be directly compressed as they consist of multiple files. However, you can compress the entire directory or use ZIP format for the shapefile components.

## Use Cases

- **GIS workflows**: Standard format in GIS applications
- **ESRI compatibility**: Working with ESRI ArcGIS data
- **Spatial analysis**: Geographic data analysis
- **Data exchange**: Common format for exchanging geographic data
- **Cartography**: Creating maps and visualizations
